is currently the Senior Staff Engineer and Tech Lead for Figma’s Databases Team.</p>
<ul>
<li>Worked at Dropbox before.</li>
<li>Was part of the 5 person team that built Dropbox’s petabyte scale search system - Nautilus.</li>
</ul>
<p>Dropbox operated data-centers on-prem since managed cloud services weren’t as good yet.</p>
<p>Dropbox stored petabyte scale metadata and exabyte scale file data. In 2013, the metadata was stored in horizontally sharded MySQL w/ 2000 shards.<br/>
They were outgrowing this system. A single organization (MIT) was going to outgrow a single database which their system didn’t account for.</p>
<p>Beyond Sharded SQL</p>
<ul>
<li>They ended up building their own Spanner-inspired distributed key-value store in-house (called Panda) since no open-source solutions were scaling to their usage. One org could now be split multiple times to get smaller shard ranges.</li>
<li>(Project Theseus) Hardest part of the project wasn’t building Panda but running the migration to re-build the entire metadata stack on top of Panda with zero downtime. It took 3 years and a team of 20 engineers.</li>
<li>Implemented atomic cross-shard txns. (2PC) across MySQL and Panda to enable the migration. Increased %age rollout of cross-shard txns. over time and eventually swapped reads from the legacy system.</li>
</ul>
<p>Joined Figma at a time when they were just in the process of scaling out their databases. Back in 2022, Figma was on a single RDS instance. DB Traffic was growing 3x every single year for the last 4 years.</p>
<p>Build vs. Buy for Database Scalability</p>
<ul>
<li>Sammy was pretty anti-build after Dropbox where everything was in-house. While building new systems in fun as an infra engineer, someone has to keep maintaining the system.</li>
<li>Figma was operating on extremely tight time horizons with a small team and 6 months of runway (before the system grew out of scale).</li>
<li>Why not NoSQL?
<ul>
<li>NoSQL does really well at scale but Figma relied a lot on joins, unique indexes and complicated relational models.</li>
<li>Would have to rewrite the entire system from scratch to use a NoSQL DB.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Spent 3 months exploring a NewSQL solution (like Cockroach, Vitess or Spanner) but couldn’t get it to work at their scale.</li>
<li>Team had a lot of expertise and historical context in RDS Postgres. Needed an incremental migration path to deliver value fast.</li>
<li>Built in-house horizontally shared-system on top of RDS Postgres.</li>
</ul>
<p>Logical vs. Physical Sharding</p>
<ul>
<li>A physical shard could have multiple logical shards.</li>
<li>Can logically shard in-place w/ no data movement by using a virtual database layer.</li>
<li>Benefits of logical sharding:
<ul>
<li>Incremental %age based rollouts
<ul>
<li>Can use logical shards for reads but let the writes go to the un-sharded database</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Low-risk fallback path</li>
<li>De-risk latency availability, correctness before physical sharding
<ul>
<li>All query, txn. logic, application changes that happen with horizontal sharding would already be running in production through the virtual shards.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Figma doesn’t use micro-services. They’ve a few large services including a service in Go that powers the real-time feature and a no. of Ruby services including a large Ruby monolith.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>DBProxy</p>
<ul>
<li>They already run a slightly modified version of pgBouncer as their database proxy. DBProxy is a Go service that sits b/w application and pgBouncer layers.</li>
<li>“Brains” of horizontal sharding. Application doesn’t need to know how the backend is actually sharded beyond including a shard key in queries.</li>
<li>Also enables load-shedding, improved observability, replica hedging etc.
<ul>
<li>If a replica goes down, then the request is sent to multiple replicas and returns when the first one succeeds.</li>
<li>Most critical routes only talk to replicas. Very few of them issue reads.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Lightweight query engine at its core.</li>
<li>Query parser taken from CockroachDB and it has worked well for them.  Logical and physical planner was built in-house.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../attachments/pasted-image-20241017190741.png" width="auto" height="auto"/></p>
<ul>
<li>(Scatter Gather query) When a shard key isn’t specified, DBProxy aggregates the results from all the shards.</li>
</ul>
<p>Query Language</p>
<ul>
<li>All single-shard queries are allowed.</li>
<li>No nested SQL queries.</li>
<li>Multi-shard writes, aggregation and group-bys are allowed but discouraged.</li>
<li>Joins are allowed iff the join is on the sharding key.</li>
</ul>
<p>Physical Sharding Operation</p>
<ul>
<li>Built in-house.</li>
<li>Uses Postgres Logical Replication to sync state.</li>
<li>Replica failovers are a no-downtime operation.</li>
<li>Primary failovers take ~10s of downtime during the critical section (In comparison, AWS RDS may take anywhere from minutes to half an hour for major upgrades).</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../attachments/pasted-image-20241017195432.png" width="auto" height="auto"/></p>
<ul>
<li>Multi-step state machine w/ automatic rollback and recovery
<ul>
<li>Disable reads at pgBouncer (PGB) layer</li>
<li>Revoke permissions from source RDS</li>
<li>Kill active queries
<ul>
<li>Since revoking permissions doesn’t stop in-flight queries</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Wait for replication sync</li>
<li>Reverse logical replication
<ul>
<li>Was logically replicating from old to new. Now replicating from source back to destination (for rollback).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Re-route pgBouncer instances to point to target</li>
<li>Re-enable permissions on target RDS</li>
<li>Re-enable pgBouncer</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Core failover operation enables vertical partitoning, horizontal shard-splits and major pg version upgrades.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../attachments/pasted-image-20241017200103.png" width="auto" height="auto"/></p>
<p>Lessons Learned</p>
<ul>
<li>You can get a long way on one database… Until you can’t
<ul>
<li>Figma was on a single pg instance from 2012 to 2020 w/o connection pooling or replicas.</li>
<li>Very few companies hit the scale where vanilla pg stops working.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Don’t be afraid to cross abstraction boundaries
<ul>
<li>Engineers often get stuck behind abstractions.</li>
<li>If something isn’t working, go read the code yourself. Applies to orgs too. Go talk to product engineers, read product code and review product designs.</li>
<li>For example, we had issues with Postgres vacuuming. Txn. wrap-around occurred regularly since pg uses a 32-bit integer for txn ids (i.e. 2^32 ~ 4 billion txn. ids). Vacuuming is very expensive and they observed that their servers would hit 100% CPU at the end of a vacuum. They had to read the pg source code to understand why this was happening and find a workaround. (There was a single lock that’s being contended on that read the entire file system into memory because query plans have been invalidated at the very end of a vacuum or analyze operation.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Data migrations are scary, so work twice as hard to make them safe.
<ul>
<li>Do data migrations with the gradual, %age based rollouts and have the ability to rollback from unknowns.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Know your customers and product
<ul>
<li>Understand how infra tradeoffs map to your organization’s priorities and ensure they align.</li>
<li>The databases team had to become experts in Figma’s product to ship horizontal sharding.</li>
<li>DBProxy does txns. by creating them on every database, issue a SELECT before commit to ensure that the DBs are still alive and then you commit in parallel. There is a span of 5ms where the DB could die and you could have a partial commit failure. At their commit volume, it’d only happen 2-3 times a year so it wasn’t a problem to worry about except for some critical txns. which were fixed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Certain early company decisions are very hard to walk back
<ul>
<li>Your data model, your ORM, and your consistency model are extremely hard to change.
<ul>
<li>At Dropbox, they had perfect consistency from day one and folks got used to that. Part of why the project took 3 years was that we couldn’t take that guarantee away from customers and had to keep giving them perfect atomic cross-shard txns.</li>
<li>At Figma, they gave replicas with nothing but a stale reads guarantee so all the product code was written to deal with that from day one.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>There is implicit tension b/w the goal of building products fast in a company’s early days vs. needing to care about scale and reliability once you’re successful. Choose your battles wisely.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Centralized on less technologies done well
<ul>
<li>Golden paths enables small infra teams to support large product orgs</li>
<li>Optimize for the good of the company over individual team’s desires</li>
<li>More technologies add complexity, reduces reliability and increases developer costs</li>
<li>Don’t gate-keep if you’re blocking the core business</li>
</ul>
</li>
