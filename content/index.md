I'm a software engineer working at [ImageKit](https://imagekit.io/) on media delivery & optimization.

I've been focusing more on things closer to computer systems for the past year.
I'm studying up on database systems right now. See my notes [here](./notes/).

I'm always on the lookout for weird book recommendations.
See what I'm reading on [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/review/list/96202479?order=d&ref=nav_mybooks&sort=date_read).
