I always wanted to have a personal website. I've been making websites since I got my personal computer (when I was 10). But the agony I've gone through to make this one is not comparable to any program I've ever written.

It took 2 years for me to finally settle on how this blog will look and what I actually wanted to write here.

At some point, this website had a dark mode and supported [JSX in Markdown](https://mdxjs.com/) too. Templates for blogs have everything you never need. I don't like clutter in my code. Small idiosyncrasies like this kept the website empty for a long while.

The design and framework changes had to stop. So, I created a mood-board in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) with a few websites I liked and then finally ended up on this design.

I only needed a place to write things in Markdown and support some customisation if I ever wanted to do that. I forced pushed everything out of the old Github repo to erase the crimes of past.

I'm using [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) now for this website along with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling. I chose Gatsby for the extension ecosystem and fast static websites by default. Tailwind keeps the markup and styling in one place which is nice for small simple things.

Wanting to write "good" and "original" posts for a technical audience prevented me from writing anything at all. I'm going to write whatever I want to from now on and put it up here.

I'm not going to write tutorials here. Another article on making a \<random-clone-app> with \<hot-trendy-stack> isn't needed. There are enough of those already.

I'm working on a few interesting things now. I'll write about them. I may even start writing my opinions on random things, technical or not.
