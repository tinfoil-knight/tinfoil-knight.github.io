It's been almost a year since I've worked on this site.

This site was built with [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) earlier. I found it to be a pretty complicated framework with too much configuration for a simple blog with markdown content.

I decided to migrate the site to using [AstroJS](https://astro.build/). I've written about my experience with AstroJS [here](https://dev.to/tinfoil_knight/my-experience-with-astrojs-294h). My main reason behind choosing AstroJS was out-of-box configuration for markdown and syntax highlighting along with really good docs & starter examples.

I'm also using [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.

Wanting to write “good” and “original” posts for a technical audience prevented me from writing anything at all. So, I've started putting out some rough articles out there now on [Hashnode](https://hashnode.com/) or [DevTo](https://dev.to/).

I'll try to put more long-lasting content here on my personal site.

I’m not going to write tutorials. Another article on making a \<random-clone-app\> with \<hot-trendy-stack\> isn’t needed. There are enough of those already.

I'll probably be writing more about my side projects or my experience as the first engineer at a small startup.

Till next time!
