I'm a software developer. Currently working remotely at [Verak](https://verak.in) (YC W21).

I like to dabble in everything from design systems on the frontend to
infrastructure as code alongside writing silly shell scripts to
automate everything.

I occasionally put out some things I've written [here](/posts).

Feel free to reach out on kunal99kundu@gmail.com or just DM me
on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kunal__kundu). I'm also on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kunal-kundu/) & [GitHub](https://github.com/tinfoil-knight).
